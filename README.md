# Slime Battle

A small 1v1 2d fight game.

## How to play

(there is not title screen for now, press space to play)

#### In this game, there are 4 classes :
- Shooter : Average class, average stats
- Rusher : Very fast, shoots very quick but as less health and makes less damage
- Tank : A lot of heath, shoots slowly but very fast projectiles that deal a lot of damage
- Tracker : Pretty much the same as shooter, but its projectiles track players if they're to close.

#### There are three types of bonus that spawn randomly on the map :
- Speed boosts increase player's Speed
- Heath bonus give you back some heath
- Fast shooting boost makes you shoot faster
These bonus are indicated by some colored arrow on the sides of the screen.

#### Controls :
- Orange : ZQSD to move, F to shooter
- Purple : Arrow keys to move, 0 numpad key to shoot
